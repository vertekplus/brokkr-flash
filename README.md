# Brokkr Flash

![brokkr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gabriel2392/brokkr-flash/main/assets/brokkr.jpg)

A modern, cross-platform Samsung device flashing utility written in C++23. Brokkr provides a command-line interface for flashing firmware partitions to Samsung Android devices using the ODIN protocol.

## Features (why is it better than etc lol)

- **Multi-device support**: Flash multiple devices in parallel
- **Wireless flashing support**: Support for TCP-based flashing for Galaxy Watch
- **Cross-platform**: Native support for Windows, Linux and MacOS
- **Compressed download support**; Samsung's Odin decompresses the lz4 stream before uploading no matter how recent is the device. We just send it compressed (if the device supports), allowing for up to 2x speed (depends on compression ratio).

## Requirements

### Build Requirements

- **C++ Standard**: C++23
- **CMake**: 3.22 or higher
- **Build System**: Ninja (or compatible)
- **Compiler**: MSVC (Windows) or GCC/Clang (Linux), Apple Clang (macOS)
- **Threads**: Standard library threading support

### Runtime Requirements

- **Windows**: Windows 7 or later
- **Linux**: Any modern Linux distribution with USB support
- **macOS**: macOS 10.15 or later

## Building

### On Windows

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
ninja
```

The compiled executable will be located at `build/brokkr.exe`

### On Linux / macOS

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
ninja
```

The compiled executable will be located at `build/brokkr`
